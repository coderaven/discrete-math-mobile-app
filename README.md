discrete-math-mobile-app
========================

A mobile java app created in Netbeans with J2ME platform. 
This app is used for solving common Discrete Math calculations.

The story behind
----------------

Well, I lost my scientific calculator and our Discrete Math instructor allows us to
use our phones to calculate things or do some operations.

It's a headache everytime I do it, so I decided to make a mobile app powered by Java J2ME
that'll do all the common calculations for me. This will make it easy for me to solve problems
in the future :D

For those who has Discrete Math as one of their subjects, feel free to use the app or modify the source code.
I'll be updating it from time to time if I find another common calculations.
