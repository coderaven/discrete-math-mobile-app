discrete-math-mobile-app
========================

A mobile java app created in Netbeans with J2ME platform. 
This app is used for solving common Discrete Math calculations.

UPDATES:
* September 27, 2012 : 
  * Added step by step solving in all the calculations and operations.
  * Added apk file for android users.

How to install
--------------

Click the "ZIP" button above to download. Extract the zip file and open the "put these files on your phone" folder.
Copy the 2 files inside and put to your phone (via memory card or usb mass storage.. Just like how you put music to
your phone). Then on your phone, open the file via file manager and install. That's it!

PS: This mobile app runs on almost every phone that supports Java (If you have Java games on your phone then
you're good to go).

UPDATE!! : 
Android phone users can now use this mobile application to their smartphones. 
Just go to the "put these files on your phone" folder and copy paste the .apk file to your phone then install :)


The story behind
----------------

Well, I lost my scientific calculator and our Discrete Math instructor allows us to
use our phones to calculate things or do some operations.

It's a headache everytime I do it, so I decided to make a mobile app powered by Java J2ME
that'll do all the common calculations for me. This will make it easy for me to solve problems
in the future :D

For those who has Discrete Math as one of their subjects, feel free to use the app or modify the source code.
I'll be updating it from time to time if I find another common calculations.
